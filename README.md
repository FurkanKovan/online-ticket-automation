# Online Ticket Automation Program (Selenium Automation)

In this project an automation bot is created for finding available and cheapest tickets on [obilet.com](https://www.obilet.com/), *from Chrome browser via Selenium(v4.3)*. Currently the only objective of the bot is to find bus tickets but further utilities will be added.

## Necessary Configurations
To test the bot on your system make sure to follow these steps:
- Download the 'chromedriver' from [here](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html). To find the appropriate version for your system check the '**chrome://version/**' tab on your Chrome browser.
- Make sure to give the path of the 'chromedriver' executable file to **'DRIVER_PATH'** variable in *'Ticket/constants.py'* file.

This project is made for educational purposes only.
